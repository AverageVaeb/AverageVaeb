HOWDY !! 
Folloowwww meeeeee !!!!
</p>
I'm Roman of the OSDD1 Jailbreak System, I'm pretty much always at the front desk, come say hi !! 
Bodily we're 15, I'm just a late teenage alter.
</p>
Always C+H for everyone unless I'm with the epic docks gang or I'm with Vixxy (rebzgng),
</p>
I appreciate all of you that just come to say hi or those that compliment my skins ^^.
</p>
EVERYTHING about us is unlabeled, and we're anti-harassment. I just wanna live, I hate putting myself in categories.
</p>
</p>
Everything is so outdated, BUT READ THE STRAWPAGE ITS UPDATED!
</p>
Please don't copy or inspo my skins, I know some would be honoured, but personally I'm uncomfortable with it... I don't want someone getting credit for something I worked hard on...
